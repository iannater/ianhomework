# UT Bootcamp First Homework Assignment

For this assignment we needed to download a directory that had an HTML, CSS, and various picture files in it. We then needed to go through the HTML doc and CSS doc and update the files to make sure that the site functioned but also make sure the code was clean and presented correctly. After correcting and verifying the HTML and CSS doc and file paths we needed to create a repo on Github and upload our changes. I checked the full functionality of the website locally and then checked it again after commiting changes to my Github repo. Below are the notes on things that I changed as well as testing that I ran. 


## Work Performed 
```
* Changed the footer div =class to the semantic "footer" and updated the CSS file to correct it not being a class anymore. 

* Changed the header from div to semantic and updated CSS

* Changed div that was inside of the header to a nav

* Changed the div class "benefits" to an aside semantic

* Changed the title in head to the company name instead of "Website"

* Fixed the broken "search engine optimization link"

* Changed all of the classes to be the same for the section and aside portion. This allowed me to clean up the code in the CSS file.

* Moved index file out of the develop folder and updated the CSS link and image links

* Added comments for the sections

* Added alt tags for images

* Updated the Footer content 

* Added main tag and then changed all divs to sections within it. 

```
